# predicting_the_probability_of_blood_donations

The purpose of this analysis is to predict the probability of an individual donating blood. The data comes from a mobile blood donation vehicle in Taiwan that drives to different college campuses and collects blood from donors during a blood drive. Based off obtained data regarding the frequency and amount of the person’s donation, we want to predict the probability of that person donating the next time the vehicle visits their campus.

Donating blood is an accessible way that a person can help save lives. While the specifics about Taiwanese blood donations are difficult to interpret, the American Red Cross estimates that “every two seconds someone in the United States needs blood” (American Red Cross, 2017). Despite the current state of technology, humanity is not able to produce blood on an industrial scale to fulfill the demand. Therefore, understanding the supply chain and logistics of obtaining donations is very important. “Although an estimated 38 percent of the U.S. population is eligible to donate blood at any given time, less than 10 percent of that eligible population actually do each year” (American Red Cross, 2017). If we can better understand the mechanisms that contribute to the decision to donate, policies and programs can be developed to increase our much-needed blood supply.
